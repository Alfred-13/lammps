This dir contains the hooks to build and link LAMMPS with the VMD
molfile plugins, http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile/.

When you build LAMMPS with its USER-MOLFILE package installed you need
to be able to dynamically load and execute the plugins from inside
LAMMPS. This requires to link with a system library containing functions
like dlopen(), dlsym() and so on for dynamic linking of executable code
into an executable.  This library is defined by setting the
molfile_SYSLIB variable in Makefile.lammps.  For Linux and most current
Unix-like operating systems, this can be kept at the default setting of
"-ldl" (on some platforms this library is called "-ldld").  For
compilation on Windows, a different mechanism is used that is part of
the Windows programming environment and thus no additional library is
needed.

molfile_SYSINC = should not need to be set
molfile_SYSLIB = linker flag or library to enable dynamic linker support
molfile_SYSPATH = should not need to be set
