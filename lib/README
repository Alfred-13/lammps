This directory contains libraries that can be linked with when
building LAMMPS, if particular packages are included in a LAMMPS
build.  The library itself must be built first, so that a lib*.a file
exists for LAMMPS to link against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to build the library.  This may require you to edit one of the
provided Makefiles to make it suitable for your machine.

The libraries included in the LAMMPS distribution are the following:

atc           atomistic-to-continuum methods, USER-ATC package
                from Reese Jones, Jeremy Templeton, Jon Zimmerman (Sandia)
awpmd         antisymmetrized wave packet molecular dynamics, AWPMD package
                from Ilya Valuev (JIHT RAS)
colvars       collective variable module (Metadynamics, ABF and more)
                from Giacomo Fiorin and Jerome Henin (ICMS, Temple U)
cuda          NVIDIA GPU routines, USER-CUDA package
                from Christian Trott (U Tech Ilmenau)
gpu           general GPU routines, GPU package
                from Mike Brown (ORNL)
linalg        subset of BLAS and LAPACK routines needed by the USER-ATC
                and USER-AWPMD packages from Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U)
meam          modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential, MEAM package
                from Greg Wagner (Sandia)
poems         POEMS rigid-body integration package, POEMS package
                from Rudranarayan Mukherjee (RPI)
qmmm          Library and wrapper to link LAMMPS and Quantum Espresso
                into an executable for hybrid QM/MM simulations.
