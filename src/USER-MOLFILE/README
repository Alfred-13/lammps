This package provides an C++ interface class to the VMD molfile plugins,
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile/ and a set of LAMMPS
classes that use this interface.

Molfile plugins provide a consistent programming interface to read and
write file formats commonly used in molecular simulations.  This package
only provides the interface code, not the plugins; these can be obtained
from a VMD installation which has to match the platform that you are
compiling LAMMPS for. By adding plugins support for new file formats can
be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or other programs that use them) without
having to recompile or change the application(s).  The plugins bundled
with VMD are usually installed in a directory inside the VMD installation
tree: <VMDHOME>/plugins/<VMDARCH>/molfile

To be able to dynamically load precompiled plugin files into LAMMPS,
you need to link with a system library containing functions like 
dlopen(), dlsym() and so on. This library is defined by setting the
molfile_SYSLIB variable in the Makefile.lammps in this directory.
For Linux and most current unix-like operating systems, this can be
kept at the default setting of "-ldl". For compilation on Windows,
this library is not needed.

NOTE: while the programming interface (API) to the plugins is backward
compatible, the binary interface (ABI) is not. So it is necessary to
compile this package with the molfile plugin header files taken from
the same VMD installation that the binary plugins were taken from.
These  header files can be found in the directory: <VMDHOME>/plugins/include
For convenience, the package ships with a set of header files compatible
with VMD 1.9 and 1.9.1 (the current version in June 2012).
