This package implements a number of pair styles that support multi-level
parallelism using OpenMP in combination with message passing via MPI in LAMMPS.

In general, the message passing version of LAMMPS parallelizes very well,
but in certain scenarios, hybrid threading plus message passing parallelization
can provide an extra speedup. For example:

- LAMMPS is in parallel over a TCP/IP network with high latencies that limit scaling.
- LAMMPS is run across many-core nodes where node-to-node bandwidth is limited
- The input is using a functionality that has unfavorable scaling yet needs to 
  be run across a large number of processors for acceptable throughput, e.g. the 
  PPPM kspace style.

In many cases a speedup of 2x or better over the best MPI-only effort has
been observed. The benefit is usually the largest when the parallel efficiency
of the MPI parallelization is dropping, i.e. there are only a few thousand
atoms or less per MPI task.

Also, most of the pair styles contain little optimizations that make the
/omp variants faster than the corresponding regular pair styles, even when
LAMMPS was compiled without OpenMP support, or only one thread per MPI
task is used.
