KEYWORDS are read from the config file in the root directory.  

KEYWORDS:
	default 	= file tested against
	test		= single file tested 
	test_folder	= directory to be tested*
	hooks		= hook for searching 
	run_data	= parameters in run output
	run_coef	= deviation coeffictients for run_data

	*Directories take precedence over single files if both keywords
	appear in the config file.  All files in a given directory must 
	be prefixed with "log.".
