tasks that need to be done in the LAMMPS-openmp 
threading project.

Axel:
- rewrite and port the remaining "complicated" pair style to threading
pair_cg_cmm_coul_long.cpp
- think about adding threading to pppm
- fourier transforms (may need extra flag to restrict fft-threads)
- update documentation
