pair_style gauss command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style gauss/cut cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff (distance units)

[Examples:]

pair_style gauss/cut 3.5
pair_coeff 1 4 0.2805 1.45 0.112 :pre


[Description:]

Style {gauss/cut} computes a Gaussian interaction potential between pairs of particles:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_gauss.jpg)

where H determines together with the standard deviation sigma_h the peak hight of the Gaussian function, and r_mh the peak position.
Examples of the use of the Gaussian potentials include implicit solvent simulations of salt ions "(Lenart)"_#Lenart and of surfactants "(Jusufi)"_#Jusufi.
In these instances the Gaussian potential mimics the hydration barrier between a pair of particles. The hydration barrier is located at r_mh
 and has a width of sigma_h. The prefactor determines the hight of the potential barrier.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

H (energy * distance units)
r_mh (distance units)
sigma_h (distance units) :ul

The global cutoff (r_c) specified in the pair_style command is used.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support parameter mixing. Coefficients must be given explicitly for each type of particle pairs. 

This pair style supports the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift
option for the energy of the Gauss-potential portion of the pair
interaction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

This style is part of the "user-gauss" package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info.

[Related commands:]

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html

[Default:] none
