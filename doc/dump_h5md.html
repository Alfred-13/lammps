<H3>dump h5md command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>dump ID group-ID h5md N file.h5
</P>
<UL><LI>ID = user-assigned name for the dump 

<LI>group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to be imaged 

<LI>h5md = style of dump command (other styles <I>atom</I> or <I>cfg</I> or <I>dcd</I> or <I>xtc</I> or <I>xyz</I> or <I>local</I> or <I>custom</I> are discussed on the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> doc page) 

<LI>N = dump every this many timesteps 

<LI>file.h5 = name of file to write to 


</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>dump h5md1 all h5md 100 dump_h5md.h5
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump a snapshot of atom coordinates every N timesteps in the <A HREF = "http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</A>
based <A HREF = "http://nongnu.org/h5md/">H5MD</A> file format.
</P>


<P>This dump style will write only one file, on the root node.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>h5md</I> dump style is part of the USER-H5MD package. It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info. It also requires
(i) building the ch5md library provided with LAMMPS (See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.) and
(ii) having the <A HREF = "http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</A> library installed (C bindings are sufficient).
The library ch5md is compiled with the h5cc wrapper provided by the HDF5 library.
