dump h5md command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID h5md N file.h5

ID = user-assigned name for the dump :ulb,l
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to be imaged :l
h5md = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page) :l
N = dump every this many timesteps :l
file.h5 = name of file to write to :l
:ule

[Examples:]

dump h5md1 all h5md 100 dump_h5md.h5

[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of atom coordinates every N timesteps in the "HDF5"_HDF5_ws
based "H5MD"_h5md file format.

:link(h5md,http://nongnu.org/h5md/)

This dump style will write only one file, on the root node.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box.

[Restrictions:]

The {h5md} dump style is part of the USER-H5MD package. It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info. It also requires
(i) building the ch5md library provided with LAMMPS (See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.) and
(ii) having the "HDF5"_HDF5_ws library installed (C bindings are sufficient).
The library ch5md is compiled with the h5cc wrapper provided by the HDF5 library.
