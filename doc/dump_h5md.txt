dump h5md command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID h5md N file.h5 args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump :ulb,l
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to be imaged :l
h5md = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page) :l
N = dump every this many timesteps :l
file.h5 = name of file to write to :l
args = list of data elements to dump, with their dump "subintervals".
At least one element must be given and image may only be present if
position is specified first. :l
  position N_position
  image
  velocity N_velocity
  force N_force
  species N_species :pre

:ule

[Examples:]

dump h5md1 all h5md 100 dump_h5md.h5 position 1 image
dump h5md1 all h5md 100 dump_h5md.h5 position 1 velocity 10 :pre

[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of atom coordinates every N timesteps in the "HDF5"_HDF5_ws
based "H5MD"_h5md file format "(de Buyl et al.)"_#h5md_cpc.
HDF5 files are binary, portable and self-describing.
This dump style will write only one file, on the root node.

:link(h5md,http://nongnu.org/h5md/)

Each data element is written every N*N_element steps. For {image}, no
subinterval is needed as it must be present at the same interval as {position}.
The box information (edges in each dimension) is stored at the same interval
than the {position} element, if present. Else it is stored every N steps.


IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box.

:line

[Restrictions:]

:ulb
The number of atoms per snapshot cannot change with the h5md style. :l
The position data is stored wrapped (box boundaries not enforced, see note above). :l
It is not possible yet to store several groups in a single H5MD file. :l
:ule

The {h5md} dump style is part of the USER-H5MD package. It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info. It also requires
(i) building the ch5md library provided with LAMMPS (See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.) and
(ii) having the "HDF5"_HDF5_ws library installed (C bindings are sufficient).
The library ch5md is compiled with the h5cc wrapper provided by the HDF5 library.
