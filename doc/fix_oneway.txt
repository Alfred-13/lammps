fix oneway command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID oneway region-ID direction Nevery :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
oneway = style name of this fix command :l
region-ID = ID of region where the fix is active :l
direction = {x} or {-x} or {y} or {-y} or {z} or {-z} :l
  coordinate component and direction of the oneway action
Nevery = apply this fix every this many timesteps :l
:ule

[Examples:]
fix ions oneway semi -x 10
fix all oneway left -z 1
fix all oneway right z 1

[Description:]

Enforce that particles can move only in one direction for either the
x-, y-, or z-direction for a given region. This is achieved through
reversing the particles' velocity component for that direction, if it
has the wrong sign. Thus particles are forced to move in one direction
only. This can be used as a simple model of, e.g. semi-permeable
membranes.
