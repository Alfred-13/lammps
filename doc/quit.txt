quit command :h3

[Syntax:]

quit status :pre

status = numerical exist status (optional)

[Examples:]

quit
if "$n > 10000" then "quit 0":pre

[Description:]

This command causes LAMMPS to exit, after shutting down all
output cleanly.

It can be used as a debug statement in an input script, to terminate
the script at some intermediate point.

It can also be used as an invoked command inside the
"then" or "else" portion of an "if"_if.html command.

The optional status argument has to be a (positive) number which
allows to signal the return status to the program calling LAMMPS.
A return status of 0 usually indicates success, a status != 0 
failure, where the specific number can be used to distinguish
error locations or kinds. If not given, a status of 0 is assumed.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"if"_if.html

[Default:] none
