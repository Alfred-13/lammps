Notes for cross-compiling LAMMPS in multiple variants from Fedora Linux
to 32-bit and 64-bit Windows using the provided MinGW64/gcc toolchain.

Set up a suitable (virtual) machine and install the following packages:
make git vim-enhanced
mingw32-nsis
mingw32-gcc-c++ mingw32-gcc-gfortran mingw32-libjpeg-static mingw32-pthreads-static mingw32-libgomp
mingw64-gcc-c++ mingw64-gcc-gfortran mingw64-libjpeg-static mingw64-pthreads-static mingw64-libgomp

Create user 'winbuild' and set password.
Use 'visudo' to allow 'winbuild' to shutdown the virtual machine
without a password by adding the line:

winbuild  ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown

Log in and create ssh key pair and append the public key the .ssh/authorized_keys
file of the repository account for automatic file transfer

Edit $HOME/.bash_profile to set environment variables for depositing files
MINGW_REPO_HOST MINGW_REPO_USER MINGW_REPO_DIR

Clone LAMMPS-ICMS tree via:
 git clone git://git.icms.temple.edu/lammps-icms.git lammps-icms

From now on, to build and sync the windows installers to the repository with:
cd ~/lammps-icms;
git pull
./tools/mingw-cross/build-mingw-cross.sh
./tools/mingw-cross/sync-to-repo.sh
