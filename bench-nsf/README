Modules used on NCSA abe
 +gcc-4.4.3
 +openmpi-1.3.2-gcc
 +fftw-3.1-gcc

 LAMMPS compiled with single precision FFT
 and OpenMP enabled (only active in /omp styles).
 Additional Fortran libraries with gfortran
 Note: jobs with 8 cores/node with MPI-only
 fail currently. requesting 7 core/node works.
 Using less than 8 cores/node with MPI-only is
 usually faster, and OpenMP+MPI often even more.

Modules used on NICS kraken:
  PrgEnv-gnu
  fftw/2.1.5.2
  gcc/4.4.4

 LAMMPS compiled with single precision FFT
 and OpenMP enabled in lmp_kraken-omp (only
 active in /omp styles).
 Additional Fortran libraries with gfortran

Modules used on TACC ranger:
  mvapich/1.0.1
  gcc/4.4.5
  self-compiled fftw3

 LAMMPS compiled with single precision FFT
